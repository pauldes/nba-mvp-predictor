    **How does it work ?**
    

    
    A statistical model is calibrated on historical data (player and team stats, and MVP voting results).
    It is used to predict this season MVP based on current data.
    The model predicts the *award share* (the number of points a player received for MVP award over the total points of all first-place votes).
    This share can be turned into a probability using various methods (see *Predictions parameters*).
